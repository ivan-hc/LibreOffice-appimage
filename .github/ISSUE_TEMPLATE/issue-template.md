NOTE, I only provide support for the JuNest-based Archimages:
- https://github.com/ivan-hc/LibreOffice-appimage/releases/tag/continuous-junest-still
- https://github.com/ivan-hc/LibreOffice-appimage/releases/tag/continuous-junest-fresh

The other ones hosted at  https://github.com/ivan-hc/LibreOffice-appimage/releases/tag/continuous-still and https://github.com/ivan-hc/LibreOffice-appimage/releases/tag/continuous-fresh are the official AppImages that I download, I extract, I re-pack and finally I re-host here to remove the libfuse2 dependency and to add more reliable update info for AppImageUpdate specifications. I can't do more than this. To complain about the official AppImage, use this link https://git.libreitalia.org/libreitalia/loaih
